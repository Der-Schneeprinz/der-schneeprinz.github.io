## About me

**Good day!** I have been studying as a student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines in the program of *BS Computer Science*. for 3 years. It would be a most welcome opportunity to experience working in an environment that will bring out the best in my abilities.

## Portfolio

Here are some of my works I made throughout the years that I was able to compile.

### Blogsite Sample

This site was built using Bootstrap and SCSS. It was a requirement for the elective taken during my second year.

These websites were created for the use of PHP as required by the proctor. The requirement also stipulates that no web frameworks be used.

### Ulam Bugdet Saver Application
